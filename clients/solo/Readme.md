# Solo Client

The *solo* application handles Eldiron based solo adventures. It contains both the server and the client parts of Eldiron.

Copy your Eldiron project file into the solo/embedded folder (the Eldiron project has to end with **.eldiron**).

After installing Rust you can just build and run the solo application with ```cargo run --release --bin solo```.
