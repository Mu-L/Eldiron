# Eldiron - Classic RPG creation

Eldiron is a creator for classic RPGs of the 80's, written in Rust. Eldiron v1 will be able to be used to create games similar to Ultima 4 and 5 with more variety planned after v1.

The game creator (which contains the game engine) is cross platform and should run on all Desktops. The game engine will work on Desktops but also on iOS and Android devices.

## Why ?

As a retired software engineer what is a better hobby than to create games similar to the ones you played in your youth ? I played the Ultima games day and night so I decided to create my own similar game, and on the way also create a game engine for this type of game.

## Features and Status

For v1 I target these features:

* Tilemap editor to select tiles in bitmaps and assign tile types and animations. (Done)
* Commission game tiles and create a modular character tile system (In progress).
* World editor to create the world and it's areas (TBD).
* Behavior tree node system for creating the RPG system and AI (TBD).
* Cooperative multiplayer for dungeons ? (Unsure if v1 or later).
* 3D Dungeons ? (Unsure if v1 or later)

## Long term

After v1 I want to add more perspectives to the game engine, like top down (U6-U7) and orthogonal views (U7+). This will require more code but also a huge amount of graphical assets. This will also depend a bit of what I can afford to commision based on the Patreon income.

## Installation and Documentation

The game creator has to be currently installed via Rust and it's cargo package manager. This is very easy todo also if you have no programming experience. The installation guide and documentation is available in the Wiki of this repo.

## License

The source and all assets I commissioned for Eldiron are licensed under the GPL. You can use the source and assets freely as long as you adhere to the guidelines of the GPL license and don't use the Eldiron name for your games.

My Patreon will offer additional licenses (MIT) for Eldiron and it's assets.
