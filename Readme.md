# Eldiron - Classic RPG creation

Eldiron is a creator for classic RPGs written in Rust. Eldiron v1 will be able to be used to create games similar to Ultima 4 and 5 with more variety planned after v1.

The game creator (which contains the game engine) is cross platform and should run on all Desktops. The game engine will work on Desktops but also on iOS and Android devices.

## Why ?

I played the Ultima games day and night so I decided to create my own similar games as I have some time to spare (what could be a better hobby ?), and on the way also develop a game creator for this type of game which I have todo for my own games anyway.

## Features and Status

For v1 I target these features:

* Tilemap editor to select tiles in bitmaps and assign tile types and animations. (Done)
* Commission game tiles and create a modular character tile system (In progress).
* World editor to create the world and it's areas (In progress).
* Behavior tree node system for creating the RPG system and AI (TBD).
* Cooperative multiplayer for dungeons ? (Unsure if v1 or later).
* 3D Dungeons ? (Unsure if v1 or later)

## Installation and Documentation

The game creator can be easily installed using Rust and it's cargo package manager. This is very easy todo even if you have no programming experience. The installation guide and documentation is available in the Wiki of this repo.
