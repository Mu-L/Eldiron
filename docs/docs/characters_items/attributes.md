This chapter lists all supported **attributes** for characters and items in Eldiron.  

Attributes can be applied to characters, items, or both.

---

## Attributes

## `active`

*Item-only attribute.*

Represents the active state of an item (on or off). When this attribute is changed, an [active event](events#active) is automatically send to the item to allow the item to sync its visual state.

```toml
active = true
```

---

## `autodamage`

*Character-only attribute.*

If set to `true`, incoming damage is applied directly by the server and the [take_damage](events#take_damage) event is skipped.
Use this for simple NPCs/targets that should not run custom damage scripts.
On lethal damage, the server also applies death state automatically (`mode = "dead"` and `visible = false`).

```toml
autodamage = true
```

---

## `autodrop`

*Character-only attribute.*

If set to `true`, the character automatically drops all inventory and equipped items to the floor on death.

```toml
autodrop = true
```

---

## `blocking`

*Item-only attribute.*

If set to `true`, the item blocks movement based on its radius.

```toml
blocking = true
```

---

## `color`

*Item-only attribute.*

Hex color code that overrides geometry color when item is equipped.

```toml
color = "#ff0000"
```

---

## `color_targets`

*Item-only attribute.*

List of geometry node names whose color should be overridden when the item is equipped.

```toml
color_targets = ["left_leg", "right_leg"]
```

---

## `geo_targets`

*Item-only attribute.*

List of linedef names to attach this item's geometry to when equipped.  
Used only when automatic matching by `slot` is insufficient.

```toml
geo_targets = ["left_shoulder", "right_shoulder"]
```

---

## `inventory_slots`

*Character-only attribute.*

Number of inventory slots the character has. If not specified, defaults to 0.

```toml
inventory_slots = 8
```

---

## `facing`

*Character-only attribute.*

Initial facing direction on spawn.  
Supported values: `"front"`, `"back"`, `"left"`, `"right"`  
(also accepts `"north"`, `"south"`, `"west"`, `"east"`).

```toml
facing = "right"
```

---

## `start_items`

*Character-only attribute.*

List of item template names to add to the character inventory on spawn (not equipped).

```toml
start_items = ["Sword", "Potion"]
```

---

## `start_equipped_items`

*Character-only attribute.*

List of item template names to add and auto-equip on spawn.  
Items must define a valid `slot` attribute.

```toml
start_equipped_items = ["Shield", "Helmet"]
```

---

## `mode`

*Character-only attribute.*

The current mode of the entity. On startup of characters this is set to **"active"**, [took_damage](server_commands#took_damage) changes this to **"dead"** when the [health attribute](/docs/configuration/game#health) is below or equal to 0. Dead characters do not receive events. Healers can set the mode attribute to **"active"** again.

```python
set_attr("mode", "active")
```

---

## `route`

*Character-only attribute.*

Patrol route definition used by [patrol](server_commands#patrol).
Each entry is a linedef `name` that belongs to the patrol path.

```toml
route = ["GuardRouteA", "GuardRouteB"]
```

You can also use a single route name:

```toml
route = "GuardRouteA"
```

---

## `route_mode`

*Character-only attribute.*

Controls route traversal mode for [patrol](server_commands#patrol).
Default is `"loop"`.

```toml
route_mode = "loop"
```

Supported values:

- `loop`: restart from the first point after the last point.
- `pingpong`: reverse direction at the route ends.

```toml
monetary = true
```

---

## `on_look`

*General attribute (applies to both characters and items).*

Shortcut for the `look` intent.

```toml
on_look = "You see a sword."
```

---

## `on_pickup`

*Item-only attribute.*

Shortcut for pickup/take behavior on items.
`on_take` is supported as an alias.

If set and the player uses `pickup`/`take` on the item:
- `"pickup"` (or `"take"`) performs default pickup logic (same as calling `take`).
- Any other text is sent as a system message.

on_drop = "You dropped a sword."
# or:
# on_drop = "You cannot drop that."
```

s = "action(backward)"
d = "action(right)"
u = "intent(use)"
```

```

---

## `static`

Light emittance can be set on / off via the [set_emit_light](server_commands#set_emit_light) command.

```toml
[light]
color = "#ffffff" # Light Color
strength = 5.0      # Strength of the Light
range = 3.0         # Range of the light
flicker = 0.4       # Amount of light flickering
```
