# Eldiron Creator v 0.8.50

## New Features

### Server

- New 'entered' and 'left' entity system events when entering / leaving named sectors.
- New 'teleport' command which either takes one argument (destination sector name in the same region) or two, the destination sector name and the name of the destination region (which will transfer the character to a different region). The entity will be transferred to the center of the destination sector.
- New `[light]` data attributes to enable light emission for entities and items.
- New 'set_emit_light(True / False)` cmd to enable / disable light emission for an entity or an item.
- New special `active` item attribute which specifies if the item is active or not. On startup (or if the attribute is changed) a new `active` event is send to the item which can than decide what to do based on the value, like enabling / disabling light emission for a torch.
- New `intent` system. Define the current player intent (like "talk", "use", "open" etc.) via the new `intent` parameter for button widgets. Server will send new `intent` events to both entities and items for direction based and click based item interations.
- New `health` config attribute which holds the name of the default entity health attribute, by default `HP`.
- New `mode` entity attribute which holds the current state string of the entity. Set to `active` on entity instantiation and `dead` when the health attribute is <= 0.
- New `death` event send to an entity when the health attribute is <= 0.
- New `id` command which returns the id of the current entity.
- New `took_damage` command (my_id, from_id, damage_amount). This command sends out messages and checks for death.
- New `goto` command (sector name, speed). Makes an NPC go to a sector.
- New  `close_in` command (target id, target radius, speed). Makes an NPC close in (in weapon range given by the target radius) of the entity id with the given speed. Once the target is in range a `closed_in` event is send.
- New `killed` event send to the attacker when he kills his target. The value of the event is the id of the dead target.
